## 2025-09-19 deimos 0.11.1, Deimos DAQ Rev 6.0.0 hardware

Tooling
* ubuntu 24.04
* kicad 8 with hierarchical PCB plugin
* protocase designer v7.2.1 linux version
  * Run like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/protocasedesigner/lib/app/natives/occjava/linux-x86_64/ /opt/protocasedesigner/bin/ProtocaseDesigner` to resolve link path issue for java runtime
* freecad 1.0.2

### Added

* Enclosure design (protocase)
* 3D assembly (freecad)
    * With STEP exports from protocase and kicad
* Rev6 schematic and layout
    * [x] Add damping in RTD current sink control loop
        * Existing circuit sees about 60mV peak-to-peak oscillation on the FET gate due to lack of damping in loop
        * Add integrator-style filter
        * Resistor from FET source to amp negative
        * Capacitor from FET gate to amp negative
        * Amp output to amp gate
        * 10k 10nF
    * [x] Use higher-voltage supply for inamp circuits again to handle common-mode without saturating
        * Without this, TC and RTD amps read low and high-gain voltage inputs saturate well within intended 0-2.5V range
        * +/-12V split rail should do the trick
    * [x] Put supply voltage on ADJ/EN pin of LDOs
        * Previous revs' 4-20mA current limiter LDOs were functioning due to a coincidental hardware bug in the LDOs that caused them to latch enabled during board startup
        * Intended behavior of the LDO chip is to be powered down when ADJ/EN is shorted to ground
        * LDO targets ADJ pin as output voltage if ADJ voltage is > enable threshold (around 1.5V)
        * Bodge-wire testing confirms that putting 12V on the ADJ pin for the 12V LDO produces the intended behavior (pass-through with short-circuit protection)
    * [x] Remove LDO output caps & add 0.1uF input caps
        * Limit inrush to avoid over-current trip during board startup
    * [x] Add 1.024V on ref pin for high-gain voltage inputs to allow measuring with symmetric noise near 0V

    * [x] Fix labeling of gain in schematic for 660x channel
    * [x] Update 3.3V zener to PN with smaller footprint
    * [x] Use back-to-back zeners for filter input to handle negative rail saturation
    * [x] Replace OPA333 with OPA196 for filters & use +/-12V split supply to get full range of 0-2.5V output
    * [x] Add -12V rail for inamp biasing
        * TI application note SLVAE10 fig 3 shows use of TPS560430 as inverting buck-boost
        * https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slvae10/slvae10.pdf
    * [x] Remove inamp from 4-20mA and G<=1 circuits in favor of overvoltage protection in filter circuits
    * [x] Remove PWM I/O logic buffers in favor of resistor-diode overvoltage protection & current-limiting
        * Buffers pull too much current & produce ground plane noise 
    * [x] Remove 5V converter that is no longer needed for anything 
    * [x] Remove extra mounting holes that will not be needed with an extrusion enclosure 
    * Prep layout for aluminum extrusion enclosure
        * https://www.protocase.com/products/electronic-enclosures/aluminum.php
        * [x] Move components back from board edge (min 0.64" clearance each side to tall parts, 0.2" to short parts & traces)
        * [x] Place remaining horizontal connectors on ends for panel access, 0.064" overhang for front/back panels

* Add record of target cutoff ratio to Sampler struct
* Use second butter1 filter bank if target cutoff ratio is below stable range for nominal butter2 filter bank
  * This will activate below a reporting rate of 40Hz, allowing proper (though less performant) filtering at the very low end of viable reporting rate
  * Minimum tabulated cutoff ratio for the butter1 filter extends to a reporting rate of 4Hz, just below the system timing minimum freq of 5Hz
* Incidentally add SVG version of logo

### Changed

* !Remove duty cycle measurement from Analog I Rev4 firmware, packet format, and calcs
    * Despite deconflicting the duty cycle measurement to a different compare-and-capture and its own pin, configuring TIM4's second CCMR for duty cycle measurement causes both CCMR1 and CCMR2 to fail to trigger
    * This is the only remaining timer module with a second pin or compatible second compare-and-capture available, so duty cycle measurement will not be available on this unit
